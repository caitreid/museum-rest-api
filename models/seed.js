The structure with recessed panels on each side suggests a wooden prototype, and recent scholarship has identified Egyptian chests as the probable models. The decoration on each side consists of geometric and vegetal ornaments well represented on contemporary pottery. The larnax stands at the beginning of an impressive series of large-scale funerary monuments in the Greek and Roman collection.", period: "Late Minoan IIIB", culture: "Minoan", medium: "Terracotta", classification: "Terracottas", image: "https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/256844/538397/main-image", onView: "true"},

The vase was filled either by immersion in a large container or through the hole on the head.
